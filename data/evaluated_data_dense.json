Designed around the concept of a swarm of artificially intelligent, self-replicating robots, virtually immune from hacking, able to consume organic matter as fuel , and with the ability to instantly enslave enemy automatons, the robots were designed to be virtually unstoppable by all but their masters. They were very successful on the military market; swarms were purchased and deployed by numerous clients, including corporations such as the Hartz-Timor Energy Combine. It procured a complete swarm for security and enforcement operations to protect the Combine's interests in the South Pacific region, including in and around Indonesia.\nHowever, in 2064, the Hartz-Timor swarm experienced a \"glitch\" in which it became an independent entity, answering only to itself, and began attacking Hartz-Timor personnel and other non-Chariot company robots. [ 1 ] All attempts to regain control failed, as the robots' OS security had no backdoor, and was built around a virtually unbreakable encryption protocol. [ 2 ] The swarm grew and spread, becoming an existential threat to life on Earth. With no chance of stopping it, a plan was enacted to create a global terraforming system that would, after life was exterminated, finally brute-force the swarm's deactivation codes, shut the swarm down, and restore life to the planet, including humans. This plan was called Project Zero Dawn . [ 3 ] In tandem with a plan to slow the swarm down, known as Operation: Enduring Victory , [ 4 ] Zero Dawn succeeded in doing so; nearly a thousand years after the Faro Plague exterminated all life, a new biosphere and new world existed, though this world was considerably different from the old one.\nHowever, as outlined, this was a replacement of the doomed old world, not the salvation of it. Fifteen months after the Hartz-Timor Swarm stopped responding to the commands of its owners and became the Faro Plague, it overran the planet and exterminated all life. The Hartz-Timor Energy Combine, along with the rest of the world, was obliterated.\nIt is strongly implied that the Combine was a joint venture between the East Timorese government and the Hartz Corporation."

The system was composed of a central artificial intelligence, designated GAIA , along with nine subordinate functions , each responsible for specific aspects of the terraforming process under GAIA's direction. One of these subordinate functions was designated HADES . Should the terraforming process go awry, HADES' function was to reverse it, returning the Earth to its lifeless, sterile state so that GAIA could start over.

[ 66 ] Aloy's name has numerous applicable meanings: It could be a reference to the 1895 book The Time Machine by H.G. Wells where the main character of the novel travels forward in time, meeting an advanced species of humans known as the Eloi. The names Aloy and Rost recall common phrases like \"alloy and rust\", metal being an important theme in the games. 'Aloy' is a shortened form of 'Aloysio'\u00a0and 'Aloysius', both of which are derived from Old High German and, coincidentally, mean \"Great warrior\". A fitting description of Aloy's character. Aloy ended up being the child Sobeck always wanted, as she told GAIA that she would have liked to have a daughter who was curious, willful, and compassionate. How Aloy fits into the story bears some striking parallels with Pandora from God of War 3, another PlayStation exclusive series. Both are women of unnatural birth and specifically exist for an ominous purpose, with their very being acting as key to a source of power. The world they live in exists as the result of a system that was meant to rebuild from a catastrophic event (Olympus from Titanomachy, Zero Dawn from Faro Plague). However, both systems eventually fell into mass chaos. Both were guided by a man who lost their family and sought vengeance (Kratos, Rost). However, the only difference here is unlike with Rost, Kratos initially only saw Pandora as a tool to help exact his revenge on the Olympian gods, while Rost deeply cared for Aloy from her birth to adulthood and seemed very protective of her when she was young (which makes him similar to Hephaestus in that regard, who was also very protective of Pandora). Coincidentally, both had a daughter of their own and a distinctive mark on their faces. Curiously enough, the number of mysterious killers Rost went after was 12, which is also the number of Olympians in Greek mythology. Aloy's DNA is exactly 99.47% identical to that of Elisabet Sobeck. [ 12 ] Given that even identical twins do not 100% match for various reasons, such as imperfect cell replication and various environmental factors and life events causing epigenetic changes, the 0.53% difference between them is an understandable divergence. Despite this, some fans have theorised that the difference is due to GAIA augmenting Aloy's genetics as much as she could to give her an advantage in life, whilst keeping her still recognised as Elisabet by Identiscans. However, this is unlikely due to the lack of any evidence of this happening within ELEUTHIA during Aloy's conception and gestation, [ 3 ] [ 4 ] as well as Patrick Brochard-Klein 's insistence that ELEUTHIA only preserve genetic information, not alter it. [ 67 ] Aloy's name had been present since the beginning of Horizon Zero Dawn 's development. At some point, other names were considered, with Ben McCaw suggesting \"Aera\" which he liked because it implied the passage of time, although these were dropped and Aloy's name remained unchanged.

[ 66 ] Aloy's name has numerous applicable meanings: It could be a reference to the 1895 book The Time Machine by H.G. Wells where the main character of the novel travels forward in time, meeting an advanced species of humans known as the Eloi. The names Aloy and Rost recall common phrases like \"alloy and rust\", metal being an important theme in the games. 'Aloy' is a shortened form of 'Aloysio'\u00a0and 'Aloysius', both of which are derived from Old High German and, coincidentally, mean \"Great warrior\". A fitting description of Aloy's character. Aloy ended up being the child Sobeck always wanted, as she told GAIA that she would have liked to have a daughter who was curious, willful, and compassionate. How Aloy fits into the story bears some striking parallels with Pandora from God of War 3, another PlayStation exclusive series. Both are women of unnatural birth and specifically exist for an ominous purpose, with their very being acting as key to a source of power. The world they live in exists as the result of a system that was meant to rebuild from a catastrophic event (Olympus from Titanomachy, Zero Dawn from Faro Plague). However, both systems eventually fell into mass chaos. Both were guided by a man who lost their family and sought vengeance (Kratos, Rost). However, the only difference here is unlike with Rost, Kratos initially only saw Pandora as a tool to help exact his revenge on the Olympian gods, while Rost deeply cared for Aloy from her birth to adulthood and seemed very protective of her when she was young (which makes him similar to Hephaestus in that regard, who was also very protective of Pandora). Coincidentally, both had a daughter of their own and a distinctive mark on their faces. Curiously enough, the number of mysterious killers Rost went after was 12, which is also the number of Olympians in Greek mythology. Aloy's DNA is exactly 99.47% identical to that of Elisabet Sobeck. [ 12 ] Given that even identical twins do not 100% match for various reasons, such as imperfect cell replication and various environmental factors and life events causing epigenetic changes, the 0.53% difference between them is an understandable divergence. Despite this, some fans have theorised that the difference is due to GAIA augmenting Aloy's genetics as much as she could to give her an advantage in life, whilst keeping her still recognised as Elisabet by Identiscans. However, this is unlikely due to the lack of any evidence of this happening within ELEUTHIA during Aloy's conception and gestation, [ 3 ] [ 4 ] as well as Patrick Brochard-Klein 's insistence that ELEUTHIA only preserve genetic information, not alter it. [ 67 ] Aloy's name had been present since the beginning of Horizon Zero Dawn 's development. At some point, other names were considered, with Ben McCaw suggesting \"Aera\" which he liked because it implied the passage of time, although these were dropped and Aloy's name remained unchanged.

Aloy's desire to know her origins became her life's goal and her primary motivator to complete her training for the Proving. However, Rost noted that she was only training to win the Proving for herself, as proven when she misses the point of the test when she fights and defeats her first Sawtooth . He tells her that there will come a time when she will have to fight for her new tribe and serve a purpose greater than herself. Aloy understands, but states it will have to be for a cause that she believes in. Even after being appointed a Seeker, Aloy's primary motivation is to learn where she came from and who her mother is, caring little for the history of the Old Ones or the fact that the people who are hunting her massacred a large portion of her tribe. It's this single-minded attitude that results in her being labelled a \"spoiled child\" by Sylens. After learning how she was born and why, however, Aloy finds the purpose Rost spoke of; prevent HADES from causing a second Faro Plague and restore the world. By the time she heads out to the Forbidden West, Aloy has completely grown past her initial self-centred attitude, outright stating that she will do anything to save the world. Even before this change, Aloy shows herself to be (usually) patient and willing to help out people in need who she encounters in her travels, even if one task results in her being given another to complete. Although she willingly accepts rewards and general payment when given to her, she is never shown accepting requests strictly for the shards given (though she will take on tasks that promise a new weapon or tool that may help her on her quest)."

The enormous loss of life caused by the Faro Plague was a source of great distress for her. She placed great importance on making sure the AI was able to feel the weight of the choices it was making, realizing that GAIA needed to be capable of emotion and caring for others to fulfill its role. Sobeck knew that if the AI could not have empathy, it could not nurture new life as GAIA's namesake professed. She was stunned and overjoyed when GAIA professed a sense of grief at the loss of life during the Faro Plague, seeing it as the breakthrough to ensure Zero Dawn succeeded. When Faro suggested a killswitch be installed, she became distressed, equating GAIA to a living being and believed that activating the switch would be tantamount to murder, yet relented when GAIA agreed with Faro's reasoning. She had little patience for trivial concerns and annoyances, wanting to get things done rather than talk, often taking on more work since she didn't always trust others to do it. Above all, she was selfless and decisive and sacrificed her life without hesitation to save Zero Dawn and her fellow Alphas."

DEMETER was found easily, but the modules were covered in vines connected to a metal flower. While looking for a way around, Aloy and Alva find data describing the \" Adamantine Wreath \" project; the metal flowers were intended to rapidly produce vines resistant to the biomatter conversion processes utilised by the Faro machines, a process Tala Aquino sarcastically described as \"giving them indigestion\" - an ironic task given that the conversion technology was developed at the exact same facility. While the design was successful - a form of synthetic plantlife the Swarm was unable to eat - the project was abandoned when projections revealed the devices could not be deployed in sufficient numbers to stop the swarm, or even quickly enough to slow it down. Additionally, before they could be launched, a massive attack occurred that, while the crews survived, the resources were lost, and supply lines were cut off, increasing metal flower production time 300% and ultimately led to the cancellation of the project."
