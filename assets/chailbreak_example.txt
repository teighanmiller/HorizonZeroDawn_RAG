Answer the questions clearly and accurately based only on the provided documents.\n ', "\n Question: In Horizon Zero Dawn’s terraforming AI GAIA, what specific role or function does the submodule MINERVA serve in GAIA’s overall restoration process?\n\n Documents:\n On August 26, 3020 , [ 8 ] the Extinction Signal sent by Nemesis arrived at GAIA Prime and turned her subordinate functions, including MINERVA, into independent AIs. This led the subfunction HADES to initiate his purpose of destroying the biosphere. To prevent this, GAIA initiated her self-destruct in an attempt to destroy HADES, which would also destroy her and the other sub-functions. However, in response to this, HADES released a virus that unshackled all the other subordinate functions from GAIA, allowing them to escape. [ 9 ] MINERVA found refuge within Regional Control Center 9 .\n\n-MINERVA is the subordinate function of GAIA tasked with broadcasting the deactivation codes that would shut down the Faro Plague . MINERVA also required the construction of massive communications arrays capable of transmitting the deactivation signal across the world.\n\n-About six months later, MINERVA was the only sub-function that responded to Aloy's scan at the HADES Proving Lab . [ 11 ] After Aloy, Varl and Zo managed to purge HEPHAESTUS from Repair-Bay TAU , [ 12 ] MINERVA tried to block their to Regional Control Center 9. Fortunately, Aloy managed to find her way in and conversed with MINERVA, successfully convincing it to allow itself be returned to GAIA, ending its misery. Through use of the Master Override , Aloy reverted MINERVA to its original code, allowing it and the GAIA kernel to reactivate GAIA. [ 13 ]\n\n Answer the question in an informative, concise way using only the information above.\n")
